While working on an ongoing project for a client, we needed to develop a modern and good looking applicatio. 
In these cases you would normally get some grahpics designed and integrated. I mostly use PNG images since they support transparent background.

PNG images allow elements to blend seamlessly with the background which creates a more polished and professional appearance for UI.

However, displaying these PNG images with transparency in MFC, can be challenging. 
For that reason we developed SG_PNGView, which is a custom control which offer a solution to this problem by enabling developers to easily display PNG images with transparency on MFC dialogs.
